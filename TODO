Script format

*   Tag "thinking" text as different from normal speech.
*   Force all text/speech on new line after directions.

Bubble placement
*   Use estimated box size instead of centre point to avoid overlaps.
*   Look again at order of arms when choosing candidate locations.

Individual panel graphics
*   Shrink text a bit.
*   Tails on speech bubbles.

Final comic
