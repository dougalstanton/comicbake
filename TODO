Script format
*   Parser needs rewritten.
*   Tag "thinking" text as different from normal speech.
*   Force all text/speech on new line after directions.

Bubble placement
*   Look again at order of arms when choosing candidate locations.

Individual panel graphics
*   Text is too near top of bubble, especially visible with small bubbles.
*   Tails on speech bubbles.
*   Thought bubbles.

Final comic
*   Episodes name, series, author attached to resulting file. Can be attached as separate strip along top/bottom of final image.
