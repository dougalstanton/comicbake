Script format
*   Force all text/speech on new line after directions.

Bubble placement
*   Look again at order of arms when choosing candidate locations.

Individual panel graphics
*   Text is too near top of bubble, especially visible with small bubbles.
*   Tails on speech bubbles.
*   Thought bubbles.

*   Allow choice of horizontal or gridded comics too.
*   Replace stitching with flickbook animation.

Uploading
